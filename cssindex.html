    <p>CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content,
      including layout, colors, and fonts.[3] This separation can improve
      content accessibility; provide more flexibility and control in the
      specification of presentation characteristics; enable multiple web
      pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate
      .css file, which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural
      content; and enable the .css file to be cached to improve the page
      load speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting.</p>
